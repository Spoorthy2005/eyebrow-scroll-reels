# Eyebrow Gesture Scroll – Instagram Reels Hands-Free

While casually watching Instagram Reels, I found myself thinking — is there a simpler way to scroll without using my hands? 🤔  
That thought led to this small experimental project: scrolling Reels using eyebrow movement 👀💡

## 🔧 Built With:
- 🔹 OpenCV for webcam input 🎥
- 🔹 MediaPipe for facial landmark detection 📍
- 🔹 Python to calculate dynamic eyebrow raise 🧠
- 🔹 pynput to simulate keypress scrolling ⌨️

The system detects an eyebrow raise and triggers a scroll — a simple yet effective way to solve a real-world inconvenience using technology ⚙️📲
